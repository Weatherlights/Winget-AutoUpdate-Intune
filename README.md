# Winget-AutoUpdate-Configurator
This project uses the Winget tool to daily update apps (with system context) and notify users when updates are available and installed.

WinGet-AutoUpdate-Configurator is based on WinGet-AutoUpdate (WAU) and allows you to configure Winget-AutoUpdate within the Microsoft Intune console using ADMX backed policies.

The WinGet-AutoUpdate-Configurator takes the configuration from Microsoft Intune and applies it to WinGet-AutoUpdate so your users stay up-to-date with their software.
